# Task 8: K-Means Clustering - AI & ML Internship

## Objective
To perform unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering on the Mall Customers dataset and visualize the customer segments.

## Dataset
- **File:** Mall_Customers.csv.xls
- **Features Used:** 
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1-100)

## Tools Used
- Python (Anaconda Notebook)
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Steps Followed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Selected relevant features and applied StandardScaler.
3. Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. Trained a KMeans model and assigned clusters.
5. Visualized clusters using Seaborn.
6. Evaluated clustering with the Silhouette Score.

## Output
- Optimal Clusters: 5 (determined by Elbow Method)
- Silhouette Score: _your score here_

## How to Run
Run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook `task_8_kmeans.ipynb` in Anaconda Navigator.
